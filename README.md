# IW_01

IW_Final.ipynb is the only code that needs to be run. Instructions for running are provided in the file. Required libraries are in requirements.txt and can be installed in a fresh conda environment using pip install -r requirements.txt.
IW.ipynb and IW_02.ipynb are provided for the sake of completeness, as they include all code written throughout. Anything mentioned in the final paper, however, is in IW_Final.ipynb (though not all results in the paper are from the last time it's been ran).
